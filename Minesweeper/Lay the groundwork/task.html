<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Minesweeper is a nerve-racking game where you're presented with a field full of hidden mines. The goal is to find all of them and stay safe. It's not a game of wild guessing, so there are hints on the field: some cells show the number of mines around them. It's all about strategy!</p>

<p>Your first step is easy: you need to output some state of the field. The field contains mines marked as <code>'X'</code> and safe cells marked as <code>'.'</code>, but you can choose your own marking symbols. At this stage, all the mines are in plain sight, so you don't have to hide them from the user yet.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, there are 10 mines on a 9x9 field. Feel free to go for any other configuration of mines.</p>
